         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Anſwer to A PAMPHLET, Intituled,
<q>Some Seaſonable Conſiderations for the Good people of Connecticut,</q> 
               <hi>Printed at New-York.</hi> 1694.</head>
            <p>IT becomes an Honeſt Writer, to introduce his Book into the World, with a Title fitting the Scope and Intendment of it: But whoſoever hath Peruſed this we are anſwering would rather have thought, ſuch a Title as this, Proper to it:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Unreaſonable Eſſayes, to Repreſent <hi>Connecticut</hi> to be Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Irreligious, Rebelious <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or ſomething Equivalent; which is the Argument of the Book, as is but too manifeſt by it. Whither under this Pretence of <hi>Seaſonable Advice</hi> there be not the greateſt Violence and Injury, offered to the Reputation, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Connecticut:</hi> will be in part ſeen, by what we have to ſay on this account. We would Unmask it therefore, only with this intimation here, that another thing than <hi>Seaſonable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> to us, is intended, and proſecuted in that Piece.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:184806:6"/>
2. As to its Seaſonableneſs: It is evidently otherwiſe; the cauſe therein Agitated, depending now before Their Majeſties, and not Iſſuable by a <hi>Pamphleters</hi> Advice; which is wholly diſproportionate to that concern: yet indeed in ſome reſpects, it may be very Seaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: namely, to ſtir Factions (though it hath miſſed that too as yet) and to make us odious to the World (which ſeems to be mainly intended in it) and to prejudice our cauſe (which he that Wrote might have been too late, for had he ſtaied the Reſult) in <hi>England;</hi> and if Occaſion ſerve, for after Severities; this is a Seaſonable fore condemning of us: If theſe, and the like, make it Seaſonable, and Suiting its writers, and Licenſers deſigns upon us, Seaſonable it is. But it may appear, that the whole work in its deſign and management, hath little of Juſtice or Charity, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it hath of the contrary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Epithet of Good People, he gives here; he utterly takes away, and contradicts all along after: the kindneſs of it here therefore is worthy no notice, but onely, that in his Title he begins not Sincerely.</p>
            <p>We muſt come to the work it ſelf: he ſaith,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> Advice was given us in the Year</hi> 1689. <hi>when we were about to make our Revolution</hi> (as tis called) and for ought I know, it had been good for us that we had taken it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. By what is moſt probable? he that gave that Advice, dwells not far from him that gives theſe aleadged Seaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſiderations: and is but his own Patron and commender here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Advice is well enough known, to have been given in the other Colonies, as well as here: the ſubſtance of it was; to manage the Government (by Commiſſions granted by Sir. <hi>Edmund Androſs</hi>) after the Revolution made at <hi>Beſton;</hi> and to decline Charters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Advice was not followed in <hi>Maſſachuſetts, Plymouth, Rhead-Iſland,</hi> no, nor <hi>York,</hi> the Reaſons have formerly been Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: we think to the Satisfaction of all, but only the Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable Enemie; of Charter Government, which is ſo well known to be dear to the People of <hi>New England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:184806:6"/>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> But we are ſo unwilling to be Adviſed, and ſo ill Affected to any, that tell us the truth, that there is little Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to any to Expoſe themſelves in that kind for the future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. Unleſs this Perſon would be attended, as the only Oracle of <hi>New-England;</hi> and impoſe on all other mens underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Conſciences: there is little Reaſon for him thus Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainingly to charge the body of the People, with being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Adviſed: and being ill affected, to any that tell us the truth; his notions were conſidered and adviſed on largely. But other Reaſons did preponderate, in the Judgment of the moſt, in a manner of all: as is well known.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Publick accounts given by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> of His Majeſties Approbation, of that Revolution at <hi>Boſton;</hi> with a now above five years implicite allowance off the meaſures here taken, might have taken of the fondneſs here paid to that advice. But ſome Counſelers, if not attended will be angry [ſo was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chittophel</hi>] and ſeek revenge ſome where.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> And it is he ſayes, <hi>An Evil time, and the Prudent ſhall keep Silence — Caſt not your Pearls before Swine &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. Its great Pitty he did not keep Silence, or ſpeak better: but if he follow not his own Advice, it will impede others to follow it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not over modeſt to Emblaz on his own Advices, thus as Pearles; and how unworthy this his Compoſure, is of ſuch a Repreſentation! will not be difficult to an Impartial Reader, to Judge of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To compare a <hi>Colony,</hi> to harmful <hi>Swine,</hi> is hard, and yet harder; when if we be ſo, in reſpect of the Advice in 1689. in a manner all the People of <hi>New-England</hi> are ſo. But ſuch a whole Sale Champman, that thus Barters all our Credite; will deſerve an Examination.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here begins, what is carried on all along his Book: namely, a miſapplication of Holy Scripture. Whether this be not a great Prophaning the Holy Name of GOD, is more meet for others to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:184806:7"/>Conſider; than for us here to ſay. What? are his Advices to be Similized with the truths of the Goſpel? which are the <hi>Pearls</hi> there ſpoken of: or is <hi>New-Englands</hi> not attending thoſe things from him, and others of his Opinion; to be repreſented and made abominable, by the felleſt Perſecution againſt the Goſpel? The Exceſſes of this kind, and the Rating and Blemiſhing (if not Curſſing us) by the mouth of Scripture; are no ſmall Scandal to us; and we deſire it may be well conſidered by the Pious Readers.</p>
            <p>But this notwithſtanding, he proceeds to tell us;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> That he hopes the caſe is not ſo deſperate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We hope ſo too, yet he all along, gives us up as in the moſt deſperate hopeleſs poſture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> He then pleads it his duty; <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart, but ſhall Rebuke him &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If any can reaſonably judge, that more of hatred, and leſs of Love could be exerted, by the <hi>Pamphleter,</hi> than is to be found in him here: they may believe he hath performed this, as his duty. But we may not dwell on every Particular. Let it be noted that the Scripture here aleadged as a warrant to this Book, is <hi>Levit</hi> 19.17. and the verſe next before it <hi>Viz.</hi> 16. is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not walk about with Tales among thy People; thou ſhalt not ſtand againſt the Blood of thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I am the Lord.</hi> Which ſeems as full and direct a prohibition of this his work as redily can be found in the <hi>Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Having thus Prefaced himſelf; our Adviſer or rather judge; and <hi>Connecticut</hi> People the Objects of his pleaſure: in the Second place, in <hi>Page</hi> 1ſt. 2d. He calls to a Serious Attention, by <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> no leſs weighty, than his Occaſion and uſe of them are Slighty; as will appear, we need not tranſcribe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> All the things he propoſes (that are true) are Obvious, and have been conſidered, and needed not his Repetition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This</hi> (like many other things) is a Repreſenting us to the World; as Ignorant and Inconſiderate to an Excels. But theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:184806:7"/>Artifices, every candid Reader will eaſily detect; to whom we refer it to conſider, whether the following things in that <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to our Advice and conſideration; or to Breath out his own Spirit againſt us, and to furniſh ill minded men, with matter and words, to defame us; to enſnare the more unwary, into hard thoughts; and many into groundleſs fears.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His Prefacing thus ended, in <hi>Page</hi> 3. He tells of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Leiutenancy</hi> over the <hi>Militia</hi> of this <hi>Colony;</hi> His Excellency Sir. <hi>William Phipps</hi> had: and ſaith:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> But upon notice hereof, a General Aſſembly was called, and met, and there it was Reſolved: Not to ſubmit to it, nor to take any notice of</hi> Sir. <hi>
                  <hi>William Phipps</hi> in that capacity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That His Excellency Sir. <hi>William Phipps,</hi> in His Commiſſion had ſuch a <hi>Leiutenancy</hi> Granted by Their Majeſties and that the General Court met, is true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That His Excellency did give an account of it, and deſired to know what Officers were in Commiſſion, and at length ſent a Copy of that His Commiſſion, is alſo true.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the General Court, at their meeting did ſend His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency an account, what our intentions were, as to Addreſſing Their Majeſties, in that behalf; and that in the Interim, the <hi>Military Officers,</hi> were to good Satisfaction, is alſo true.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the Reſolve of the Court, here aſſerted: We ſay theſe things. (1.) That it ſeems to be of abſolute neceſſity, to the ends of the <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> to charge ſuch Reſolves, and Acts of the Court, upon them with Riſing in Arms <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Elſe, they could not make out, Oppoſing Their Majeſties, and ſo lay a foundation large enough, to Superſtruct all the revilings and menaces, that for the ends he had before him, muſt be uſed. (2.) If ſuch a Reſolve were, our Governour, who was then in Court, muſt put the Queſtion, which it did Reſolve, and this is an high Reflection on him. (3.) Since this <hi>Pamphlet</hi> was <hi>Licenſed</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> and things of this nature Aſſerted in it; it behoved in Juſtice, that he had Atteſted Copies, or other Equivalent aſſurance of it ere he thus expoſe us. (4.) We love not ſuch courſe words as to tell the World that what is ſo ſaid, is an abſolute Lye: and yet this we muſt ſay (if we will ſay the truth) for there was no ſuch Queſtion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:184806:8"/>
               <hi>put,</hi> nor no ſuch Reſolve made; and we challenge them to prove it, that ſay it: and who that finds ſuch things, ſo certified, and hears no other, would doubt the truth of it; or demurr to conclude us Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Oppoſers of Their Majeſties. But we have more of this kind, to come in yet, wherein an amazing, Impudent Falſifying, is uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. (5.) It will not heal the evil to make a <hi>Subterfuge</hi> of any inferences from other things, as arguing ſuch a Reſolve: for 'tis matter of Fact, that is here aſſerted, and not brought in as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of what was matter of Fact: for that had been but Opinion; whereas this is Exhibited, as a Court Act, or Reſolve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> He ſaies further, <hi>At another General Aſſembly, we reſolve to to Addreſs Their Majeſties forthwith</hi> — (and) <hi>yet no Addreſs is made to Their Majeſties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not true to ſay no Addreſs is made, we did forthwith, with all poſſible diligence, ſend our Addreſs: that we have no account of it, is from other cauſes than our not ſending. It is a very ſad thing thus openly to be rendred as meer diſſemblers, with Sir. <hi>William,</hi> and Their Majeſties Eſpecially: but this is the meaſure that is mete us, and ſurely Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> gave his <hi>Imprimatur</hi> on very fallible grounds to this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> After which, Sir. <hi>William Phipps</hi> making ſome further demands in the</hi> Spring 1693. <hi>we promiſed to pay him ſome Hundreds of Pounds, and to take upon us the defence of the upper</hi> Towns, <hi>upon the River, belonging to the</hi> Maſſachuſetts. <hi>As if theſe things would Satisfy Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Commiſſion?</hi> (and theſe things, in <hi>Page</hi> 6.) he calleth a <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with Sir. <hi>William Phipps,</hi> which gives his meaning, and what he would ſuggeſt, and have believed in the World, as to the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions between His Excellency, and this <hi>Colony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He that hath only this <hi>Pamphlets</hi> information in this, and Credits it, will be tempted to think; that thoſe Hundreds of Pounds were a <hi>Bribe,</hi> engaged and accepted. This is an Affront to His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency as well as to us, to Repreſent a thing after this manner, which was in ſome ſort true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The truth was, in Effect only this: <hi>His Excellency deſigning to diſreſt the Enemy</hi> Indians, <hi>at the</hi> Eaſtward, <hi>ſent to us for men to Aid
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:184806:8"/>therein; and becauſe we could not (without great inconvenience) ſend men ſo far</hi> (<hi>by two</hi> Gentlemen <hi>that were ſent down on purpoſe</hi>) <hi>we tendred</hi> 400. Pound, <hi>for furthering that Expedition, if it went on as was propounded: but not a Penny to compound with him, about his Commiſſion, as the</hi> Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet <hi>would inſinuate: and the Offer was made openly to His</hi> Hxcellencies Council; <hi>not ſecretly to His</hi> Excellency: <hi>and which was done ſincerely for Their</hi> Majeſties <hi>Service: and we muſt complain of this partial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and Repreſentation of the</hi> Pamphlets; <hi>as ſetting a falſe face on, and miſconſtruing that Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We undertook not abſolutely, the defence of the upper <hi>Towns;</hi> but only to ſuch a number of men, as occaſion ſhould be: which was accordingly performed, to our no ſmall charge: but to an envious eye, will pervert the beſt actions, in accounting them to the World for what they never were.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here we muſt remark, the obſervable difference, between the Treatment we had with His <hi>Excellency</hi> and the <hi>Gent.</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and what we now have from this writer, on theſe Occaſions. We may believe, that they had as more to do with it, ſo as much Integrity and Prudence, to manage ſuch a thing with us, and much more, than this medler, yet never handled it as he has done.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Notwithſtanding this ſeeming care for this firſt Commiſſion, it is to be noted, that in all the time of it, our Adverſary never gave us any ſuch <hi>Seaſonable Advice,</hi> to comply with it, as now, in a Month (as it is intimated in <hi>Page</hi> 7.) he is all on a light fire againſt us, why were not the dangers of delaying, and addreſſing, then ſet before us; ſince himſelf ſaith, <hi>that ſincere Obedience is Univerſal.</hi> So would his to Their Majeſties, and Love to us, have been in a <hi>then</hi> adviſing, if he had been Equally poiſed. But this his partiality, may make ſome ſuſpect that all this kindneſs for the firſt Commiſſion, is but a meer <hi>Shooing horn</hi> to his deſigns by the ſecond: and that he Loves <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> much alike.</p>
            <p n="6">6. What is fit, in anſwer to this <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> to be ſaid why we gave ſuch an Anſwer, as we did to this Commiſſion, will occur afterwards, on account of the Commiſſion of His <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>York;</hi> which being the conteſt with that writer, we do refer to what will follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> In <hi>Page</hi> 3d. he begins, and ſo goes on, with an account of the like Commiſſion of Leiutenancy, given by Their Majeſties to His
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:184806:9"/>Excellency <hi>Col. Benjamin Fletcher;</hi> and remarks upon it, <hi>That upon notice hereof, the Freemen and Souldiers in the ſeveral Towns, are Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; to ſee how they ſtood affected, and what they will Contribute, towards Addreſſing Their Majeſties in this behalf. A General Aſſembly alſo is called and meets, and there it is reſolved, forthwith to ſend an</hi> Agent <hi>for</hi> England: <hi>Money is provided &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. And was not this Lawful and neceſſary? It hath been declared with ſufficient Authority, <hi>That it is the right of the Subject to Petition the King.</hi> Let the <hi>Biſhops</hi> caſe and what the <hi>Convention Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> declared, be remembred; and might not in Lawful peaceable meetings, the Peoples minds be inquired into? and if they are found (as they were) ſo ſenſible of their concernment herein, that (in a manner) they Unanimouſly declare for an Addreſs to Their Majeſties, is it not thereupon juſt to take care for the Charges to defray it: and if this Unanimity and Vigorouſneſs, grieve the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> and his <hi>Abettors,</hi> we are not therefore to be blamed. But this Arrow will not peirce, unleſs he head it. Wherefore he adds, as a part of that Courts Concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> And Laſtly, <hi>That if any ſuch Commiſſion do come, in the mean time they will not ſubmit to it, but oppoſe it, till they have anſwer from Their Majeſties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He ſeems to be very ſenſible, that all his labour will be loſt, and his whole deſign (of Defaming <hi>Connecticut</hi>) fruſtrate, if he do not charge us with Explicite Reſolves againſt Their Majeſties; and therefore if truth will not aford him matter for it; Lyes muſt and ſhall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſay of this, as of the other Reſolve, charged on us about the Commiſſion to <hi>Sir. <hi>William;</hi>
               </hi> that it is a meer falſhood, forgery, our Records, and the whole Court are Witneſſes of the contrary of it; and this, though for its truth, it could not have an <hi>Imprimatur,</hi> yet for its uſefulneſs, it muſt be paſſed to the <hi>Preſs.</hi> It was ſaid of old by <hi>Cyprian, that ſome went abroad with Lyes, as if truth could not follow them.</hi> And as one ſayes of him that wrote the <hi>Romiſh Legends; That he had an Iron Forehead.</hi> So we may ſay of him, that Aſſerts as here a matter of Fact, which never had any being; and that of the Repreſentative Body of the <hi>Colony:</hi> and to ſuch perverſe ends. The Court Reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:184806:9"/>or Concluded, only of an Addreſs to Their Majeſties, with what was neceſſary to it, as the charges, Perſon <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If theſe two great falſhoods, of the writer of that Book newly mentioned, and a third of Riſeing in Arms (which we ſhall meet with afterwards) be ſet aſide, as they ought to be, for ſtark Lyes, that have not a Ragg of truth to Cover their Shame: all the reſt affirmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us (whither true or falſe) is too weak to bear the weight of his Reproaches caſt on us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> By theſe methods</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the Freemen of the Corporation, and as many of the People as will fall in with them, are enſnared, and ſtrengly Preingaged, to make Oppoſition againſt Their Majeſties Commiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> They engage only hereby in an Addreſs; not in, or to, an Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam. Inſomuch that one Jeers, another will ſpend his Blood to keep off His Excellency &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There is not much (if any thing) to be believed on his Credit, nor his <hi>Imprimaturs,</hi> in this buſineſs; who have ſo departed from truth in what they affirm, and paſs, of the General Court.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though we have heard of no ſuch ſpeeches (from any perſons of Credit) yet can we not ſay, but ſome Rude Perſons, may have talked at this Rude Rate, and poſſibly on the as rude Provocations of ſome others. But ſtill, is this fit to be uſed in reproach of a whole <hi>Colony,</hi> when yet none of the offenders were brought to any of the Majeſtrates, to anſwer ſuch things? the particular Perſons (if ſuch there were) ſhould have been named, and the evil confined to them: we take it as a wrong, to have theſe things indefinitely and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly caſt on us, as if it were a common and general Practice; and hereon to ground in great part, the heavy imputations that follow. We ſhall oft meet with theſe kind of things: let this ſtand for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them, wherever they occur in the <hi>Pamphlet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> In <hi>Page</hi> 5. he gives an account of His Excellencies coming to <hi>Hartford,</hi> Reading his Commiſſion, leaving a memorial of it <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in Particular, that he Aſſures us, <hi>That he hath neither power, nor intent to invade our Civil Liberties; That in caſe of our Submiſſion, he would Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionate all that were in Commiſſion before, and take our Advice for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:184806:10"/>ſupply of Vacant Places. And particularly tender a Commiſſion to our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, for the Command of the</hi> Militia <hi>in the</hi> Colony; <hi>only in Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to this Their Majeſties Commiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We muſt defer the anſwer to this a little while, and ſee firſt his account of the Succeſs of it, on the Court, in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> The Deputies (divers of them at leaſt) being ſo prepared as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, are Reſolved before hand, and have determined the Queſtion before the Court meets (God hath given them ſuch a priviledge) and therefore if Their Majeſties put ſuch things upon them, they muſt oppoſe, and hold their own, they are bound in Conſcience to do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This Repreſentation of the Deputies, as prereſolved to Oppoſe Their Majeſties Commiſſion, is unlimited, and unproved, and therefore as here and afterwards improved, is an evil Surmiſe, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes all the Deputies, and the whole <hi>Colony,</hi> and opens a wide Door to any ſuch Calumnies; but as long as it is wound up, to Reſolving to oppoſe, it muſt be worthy of an <hi>Imprimatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Court Act on this matter, ſhews what the Deputies minds were in it; and in honeſty he ſhould have produced that; and then they had ſpoken for themſelves, and not out of the mouth of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. But that anſwer of the General Court, ſpeakes not Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Their Majeſties, loud enough, he perceives, but Subjection; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all his Book he recites it not, but in ſtead of it pops off his Readers with this Surmiſe, and other miſaccountings of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> He then troubles himſelf with the</hi> Halberteers; <hi>as if they were deſigning to Conceal the Commiſſion from being known &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Tis a ſilly thing thus to imagine as he doth, why ſhould any deſire, or with what hopes endeavour a concealment? There were but four <hi>Halberts,</hi> and it was only to prevent a throng at firſt; the People were inſtantly admitted. But he adds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> And no marvel the General Court not overwilling to give the Commiſſion a hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is another tacit Scandal caſt on the General Court, who waited many dayes to give it an hearing (and this our Records and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:184806:10"/>the Printed account of thoſe Tranſactions, Publiſhed by His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency do prove) and ſate ſeveral dayes on it: and therefore for him to ſay, as he does on it; <hi>That the Court take no great notice of His Excellency, wave the buſineſs, would bring him to Compoſition, as they had done</hi> Sir. <hi>
                  <hi>William</hi> &amp;c.</hi> is apparently a miſtake; we did take notice and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as the account mentioned ſhews.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> But he thought (it ſeems) that it would manifeſt Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſend, as he ſayes, <hi>Orders to ſuch as Command the</hi> Forts, <hi>to prevent their Seizure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This miſconſtruction of Actions, is a frequent thing in this <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> The order he ſhould have Printed, if there were any thing of an Oppoſition to His Excellency in it. The truth, and all of it is, That at that time, there was a <hi>Pyrate</hi> or Enemy on the Coaſt; that took many <hi>Veſſels;</hi> and it is uſual with our General Courts, when they ſit, to renew Orders of that kind, and that was what was then done: yet this is Rattled into the World, as a kind of Rebellion, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we are told of holding <hi>Forts</hi> againſt the King, wherein he ſeems to refer to this, but all that know our two poor <hi>Forts,</hi> may well Judge us all mad if we ſhould attempt to hold them againſt the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> He goes on ſaying, <hi>And it ſeems (if the common Fame be true) it is their Opinion, That Their Majeſties have nothing to do with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. One would have thought that the <hi>Topicks</hi> of Lyes, evil Surmiſes, miſrepreſenting things, miſconſtruction of Actions, miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Scriptures, and Laws; which are the <hi>Nervous</hi> parts of this <hi>Pamphlet;</hi> had been enough to furniſh the Railery of it, without taking in Fame, and wronging it too; for it may be truly anſwered, that unleſs this <hi>Pamphlet</hi> by defaming, have ſo famed us, we never were ſo Reputed, in a common way, or at all as we know of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What could he ſay worſe of us, than that it is our General Courts Opinion (for of them he ſpeaks) that Their Majeſties have nothing to do with us? It is fitter indeed to be anſwered with renting our Cloaths in deteſtation, than with words. Do we not profeſſedly and practically, hold all under Their Majeſties? and Serve them to our Capacity as the reſt of Their Subjects do? Say it be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as yet, in this one point of the Commiſſions? is all Allegiance
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:184806:11"/>renounced, in one demur (on juſt Reaſons as we truſt) and about which we have (at great charge) ſent with all ſpeed to Their Majeſties.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let it be conſidered, what theſe his dealings with Their Majeſties poor afflicted Subjects will prove; of his and his <hi>Imprimaturs</hi> Subjection to Their Majeſties? however highly they word it for their Allegiance?</p>

                  <hi>Pam.</hi> He adds, in Page</hi> 6 <hi>&amp;</hi> 7th. <hi>That hereon Commiſſions from His Excellency are declined, abuſes offered him, and ſuch of the Aſſembly as moved for Submiſſion, thought unfit for their places; ſuch as yeild obedience tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as Rogues</hi> (and with the reſt) <hi>yea ſome riſe in Arms to Oppoſe him, and others are in readineſs upon Occaſion to do the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This of riſing in Arms to oppoſe His Excellency here Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted; is as falſe as any thing that can be told: that ſome came to <hi>Hartford</hi> with ſome Arms to liſt under His Excellency hath been ſaid: but this cannot be the thing charged; alſo that ſome <hi>Troopers</hi> were appointed and went to wait on His Excellency to conduct him into <hi>Hartford,</hi> is true; but His Excellency came not at the time Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they went no more. A Training was in hand but put by, by the Governours Order. Beſides theſe (by all the enquiry we can make) no one man was in Arms in the <hi>Colony,</hi> while His Excellency was here: unleſs the <hi>Halberteers</hi> mentioned afore, and our uſual Guards on the Lords Dayes; much leſs did any Riſe againſt His Excellency, and leaſt of all, yea not at all, as is here ſuggeſted to Strangers as a general thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This falſe charge, is by its confident Aſſerting, and Licenſing paſt into the World; and down to Poſterity, as a real truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are by it greatly wronged, rendred (as the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> hath to effect his deſigns a neceſſity) as in open Rebellion. As to that of others being ready to Riſe, it is only Surmiſed. The ſame we ſay of what was ſaid of ſome of the Members of the Court, being thought unfit for their places; and the traducing of ſome as Rogues; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes offered His Excellency; theſe things we have anſwered afore, that tis the particulars (if any ſuch be) that are blameable not the whole or body of the People. As to the not taking Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it will occur afterwards to be ſpoken unto.</p>

               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> In Page</hi> 7 <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. <hi>Several things are ſaid of a Proclamation, left with</hi> Coll. Allyn, <hi>imparted to the Governour, and fault is found that it was not publiſhed, and ſo of a ſecond Proclamation ſent from</hi> York.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:184806:11"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Let our General Courts Anſwer be conſidered; and that will ſhew how improper it was for our Governour to Publiſh thoſe Proclamations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Was it not enough that no hindrance was given His Excellency when here, and that he yet did not do it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> In Page</hi> 8 <hi>he takes it for granted, that all former</hi> Military <hi>Commiſſions are Expreſsly determined, by the Publication of this: and therefore finds fault with</hi> Trainings, <hi>and adds, 'tis ſaid, we have made a</hi> Major <hi>too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. His Opinion differs from the General Courts, in the firſt point, but that being Controverſal, it is before Their Majeſties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Trainings</hi> in the interim; it was it ſeems thought meet by ſome Officers, not to deſiſt, and thereby let the Souldiers grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted for Service, but attend what the Law requires in a time of War as this is, here being none in Commiſſion neither, but what had Commiſſions from the General Court; and a Vacancy at this junture, ſeems not ſafe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to a <hi>Major;</hi> the <hi>Major Winthrop</hi> being gone for <hi>England,</hi> the General Care of <hi>New-London</hi> County, which is moſt expoſed to danger from the Sea, required ſomewhat of a Special Order in that reſpect. Our duty to Their Majeſties in our preſent Circumſtances do admit, and require, that we omit nothing wherein we may beſt Serve them. But theſe Trainings <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his uſual heat he ill reſents, and declares againſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> Thus we make all the defiance to Their Majeſties, and Their Commiſſion, trample them into the very dirt, and offend with as high an hand, as is well poſſible for us to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is time now to ſay ſomewhat more, to take of theſe heavy Imputations, and we will promiſe to do it; that there are ſeveral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things, that are not convenient on the Provocations of this <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,</hi> to be made Publick. Nor may a few, undertake to give the whole ſence of the General Court and Country. We ſhall content our ſelves, and we hope ſatisfy the Reader, with what anſwers this <hi>Pamphlet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then we ſay, the <hi>Militia</hi> is the Kings. So ſays he in <hi>Page</hi> 25. and onwards.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is ſo declared by two Acts of Parliament, 13 <hi>&amp;</hi> 13th. and 14th. of <hi>Charles II.</hi> So ſaith he, <hi>Page</hi> 26.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Militia</hi> that is the Kings, and ſo declared in thoſe Acts, is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:184806:12"/>the <hi>Militia</hi> intended in the Commiſſion to <hi>Sir. <hi>William Phipps,</hi>
               </hi> and now to His Excellency of <hi>York:</hi> So he Argues, <hi>Page</hi> 26. ſaying, <hi>It is declared by two ſeveral Acts of Parliament, of</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. <hi>and</hi> 14. <hi>of</hi> Charles <hi>II. and of this His Maieſty was pleaſed to put us in mind, by expreſs mention of the firſt of theſe Statutes in the Commiſſion to</hi> Sir. <hi>William Phipps.</hi> And in <hi>Page</hi> 3. he calls the Commiſſion to His Excellency of <hi>York, a like Commiſſion;</hi> and argues in <hi>Page</hi> 26. and onward, <hi>our duty to obey this Commiſſion, by Vertue of thoſe Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The latter of thoſe Acts, do to determine the whole Regulation of the Kings <hi>Militia,</hi> in 36 Articles; according to which His Majeſties <hi>Leiutenants,</hi> we conceive muſt Execute their Office: this we think is indiſputable, unleſs that Act be void, or vainly urged on us by our <hi>Antagoniſt.</hi> We deſire that a ſpecial notice may be taken, that this Act of 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. of <hi>Charles II.</hi> is the Limit, and Boundary of the Kings <hi>Militia,</hi> as it is Committed to, and is to be Commanded by the Kings <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> as ſuch: and that if this be plucked up. (1.) The very <hi>Leiutenancy</hi> is taken away, being as to Law founded only hereon. And (2.) That if the Kings <hi>Leiutenants</hi> as ſuch, can claime, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a <hi>Militia</hi> as the Kings, beyond the meaſure of this Act, what ſhall ſtop them from Commanding, who when, and in what manner ſo ever they pleaſe? (3.) The word <hi>[Militia]</hi> as it relates to the King and His <hi>Leiutenants,</hi> is reſtrained to this Act, and does not take in all that ſtrictly may be denominated <hi>[Militia]</hi> for in a large ſence, <hi>Corporations, Towns, Families,</hi> yea ſingle <hi>Perſons;</hi> have, and may have, that Furniture for War, offending and defending, as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Capacities do require, and admit, that may be called truly and properly [their <hi>Militia</hi>] and yet neither the things ſo called, nor that name, ſhall incorporate them into the Kings <hi>Militia;</hi> and put them under His <hi>Lieutenant.</hi> (4.) That when the King makes His <hi>Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> that <hi>Leiutenancy</hi> is neceſſarily refered to this Law, and ſtands in Connexion to it; and all words and clauſes, in the <hi>Leiutenants</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, muſt be accomodated to the tenor and true intent of this Act; and not otherwiſe: for as it is <hi>Leiutenancy,</hi> ſo tis but <hi>Leiutenancy,</hi> and what <hi>Leiutenancy</hi> ſhall be, and how far extend, this Act provides; theſe things we refer to the Readers notice in this whole conteſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the third Article or Paragraph, as <hi>Wingate</hi> renders it, is ſaid, that the Leiutenants <hi>&amp;c. May charge any, where their Eſtates be, with Horſs, Horſman, and Arms, that have</hi> 500 Pound Per. Annum <hi>in Poſeſſion,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:184806:12"/>or</hi> 6000 Pounds, <hi>in Goods or Money beſides furnitue of their Houſes, and ſo Proportionably: And any with a Foot Souldier and Arms, that have</hi> 50 Pounds Per. Annum, <hi>in Poſeſſion, or</hi> 600 Pounds <hi>in Goods or Money, other than Stock on the ground, and ſo Proportionably; they ſhall charge none to find both Horſs and Foot in the ſame County.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We need recite no more here, only in the cloſe of the foregoing Paragraph; it is ſaid, <hi>And the ſaid Leiutenants, and in their abſence or otherwiſe by their directions, the deputy Leiutenants, or any two or more of them, may Exerciſe and Conduct the Perſons ſo to be Armed &amp;c. as is here after expreſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 25. Article or Paragraph, we find to the ſame Effect. <hi>Viz.</hi> The <hi>Leiutenant &amp;c. May from time to time Lead, Train &amp;c. all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Raiſed and Arrayed, according to the Act of</hi> 13 <hi>and</hi> 14. <hi>of</hi> Charles <hi>II.</hi> Chap. 3. Here it ſeems very plain, (1.) What the Kings <hi>Militia</hi> is. <hi>viz.</hi> Perſons of ſuch Eſtates as are mentioned. (2.) That the Kings <hi>Leiutenants</hi> as ſuch, and by Law have only thoſe Perſons of thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates under their charge and power. As yet nothing is offered us to prove it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is no ſuch <hi>Militia</hi> ſo conſtituted, yet formed in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut;</hi> therefore no Subject or Object of ſuch a <hi>Leiutenancy,</hi> yet formally Exiſting here; this is well enough known.</p>
            <p n="7">7. His <hi>Excellency</hi> nor <hi>Sir. <hi>William,</hi>
               </hi> ever went about forming ſuch a <hi>Militia</hi> here, by and according to the 3d. 4th. 5th. and 10th. Articles or Paragraphs, of the ſaid Acts of Parliament: therefore were not oppoſed in Executing their reſpective <hi>Leiutenancies</hi> according to the Acts referred to in their Commiſſions: and Conſequently not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in their Commiſſions rightly underſtood and applyed; and as the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> argues for them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> as now conſtituted by the General Court, by vertue of the Charter, and as our need requires; conſiſts of all Males from 16 to 60 years of Age, ſome few, as <hi>Majeſtrates, Miniſters &amp;c.</hi> only excepted, be their Eſtates what they will.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus, the Queſtion is whether the Kings <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> conſtituted, and to be Governed as by ſaid Acts, or the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>Militia,</hi> of another conſtitution, and Government (and therefore ſo conſtituted becauſe ſo to be Governed) be the Object of the <hi>Leiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantcy?</hi> the diſputes of the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> run for the latter; but ſtill wholly on grounds taken only from the former; but that will not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:184806:13"/>hold: for what Their Majeſties claime by Law (that is by thoſe Acts) they furely Execute upon, according to the ſame Law or Acts of Parliament. 'Tis an happy truth, that all the People are Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, yet are not all by Act of Parliament from 16 to 60 years of Age (that is Males) His ſtanding <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this had come to practice here and His Excellency had called all from 16 to 60 to the duty of Souldiers, and they had refuſed as not having Eſtates to Oblige them by the Laws, his Commiſſion is dependant on and muſt be exerciſed by; and the Corporation <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> ſtrictly ſo called had been ſevered there from; what a poor poſture had that been in? when it may be the <hi>Colony</hi> would not have yielded an Hundred Souldiers to that part, it may be not half an hundred?</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, doth not the Commiſſion ſay; the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> all the <hi>Forces &amp;c.</hi> And this anſwers all. We ſay no: For we know His Majeſty Governs by the Laws of the Realm; and this our Adverſary not only yields us, but makes it the <hi>Baſis</hi> of all his Arguing, in <hi>Page</hi> 23. where he ſaith, <hi>In this caſe, (Rex praecipit &amp; Lex praecipit) the Kings Commands and the Laws Commauds, is all one.</hi> So that by his own account the Laws Command and the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the caſe are Mutual, and Reciprocal and do expound each other; that is the Statute of 13 <hi>&amp;</hi> 13 and 14 of <hi>Charles II.</hi> do expound this Commiſſion of <hi>Leiutenancy,</hi> and all others of that kind and in the ſence and under the Limitations of thoſe Acts, it is to be taken and no otherwiſe. And this alone with the Conſideration of the Conſtitution of <hi>Connecticut Militia,</hi> at once over throws utterly his whole <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> in the <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> And he might have ſpared the labour of all his <hi>Sophiſtications,</hi> in arguing and concluding as he doth from the one to the other, when as not the ſame thing, or a thing of the ſame Conſtitution is in both.</p>
            <p>And here we muſt note his miſrepreſentation of thoſe Statutes as intending a <hi>Militia,</hi> which they do not by applying them directly to another kind of <hi>Militia,</hi> as he doth evidently all along. It is like he knew that they are but few Comparatively that Read thoſe Laws, and yet fewer of his Readers that know or will be informed what a different <hi>Militia</hi> from that, <hi>Connecticut Militia</hi> is: and ſo the <hi>Ambiguity</hi> of the word <hi>Militia</hi> would not be dicovered; and ſo it muſt and would be concluded, that if we hold any <hi>Militia,</hi> it was the ſame in the Statutes,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:184806:13"/>(this is no fair dealing in him) His Majeſty claimes His right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe Laws, and what is by Patent Granted to His Subjects, and is of another Conſtitution, we may be bold to hold that, till we can enquire His Majeſties right and pleaſure to be otherwiſe, and in this we claim not His Majeſties <hi>Militia,</hi> as it is diſtinguiſhed from, our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration <hi>Militia,</hi> it is all His Majeſties in Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a word,</hi> what is the Kings <hi>Militia</hi> ſo ſettled by the Laws of His Realm, we never gave the leaſt hindrance unto His <hi>Leiutenants</hi> in: if they had clamed the Command of that and that only, and had been refuſed; ſome ſuch Charges, as now we are laden with, might have had a colour, whereas now they have none. To a full manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof, many other things ſhould and might be added; but this may ſuffice to ſhow that the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> by not diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Militia</hi> and <hi>Militia,</hi> runs into all manner of confuſion; and chargeth us with claiming the Kings right, when we claim it not; but a diſtinct thing, and not that neither, but in Subjection to Their Majeſties (what of the Kings <hi>Militia</hi> is involved in the Corporations we know not, till it be diſtinguiſhed as the Law requires) if theſe things be not clear to others, they are ſo to us, and will bear at leaſt an enquiry in <hi>England,</hi> before we be put on, to what we are not clear in; and this may be the better born with, ſince as he ſaid in <hi>Page</hi> 5th. <hi>His Excellency offered to continue the</hi> Militia <hi>in the hands it was then in,</hi> which ſhewed a good Satisfaction in the <hi>Military</hi> Commiſſion Officers; the odds of being under the Corporation, or His Excellency, till we could here from <hi>England,</hi> needed not the Sharpneſs of this <hi>Pamphlet;</hi> which hath nothing helped; ſave to render us as bad as poſſible, and beyond truth, or peace.</p>
            <p>And here we might end our anſwer; but becauſe of the long and bitter <hi>Harrangue</hi> that continues in that Book, and ſome things that muſt be cleared, we muſt attend it. And at once we will inſert the Courts Anſwer to <hi>Coll. Fletcher,</hi> that all may ſee what it was, and not take it in the diſguiſes that are put on it; and it ſhall be as it was Printed at <hi>York. Viz.</hi>

And this is ſpoken only with reſpect to the Corporation <hi>Militia,</hi> not at all with reſpect to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia Conſtituted as by the 13 <hi>and</hi> 14 <hi>of Charles II.</hi> which for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction we call the Kings Militia, and on the reaſons there aleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the full import of which is for Their Majeſties ſpecial Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and with a proviſion to do our duty as to aiding <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Albany.</hi> And what does this amount to but our Courts ſence, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Opinion, in the matter of their duty.</p>
            <p>Let any man cooly Conſider, whether this be not juſtifiable, whether this will bear all the Mountainous weights of Reproach, which this wretched <hi>Pamphlet</hi> caſts on us on this accout? And had the <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter</hi> dealt with any honeſty, he ſhould have proved that for our Court thus to declare their ſence is Oppoſing the King, and what elſe he loads us withal; and not publiſh Horrid Lyes of us, and then argue from them. We know that ſins and vices are <hi>Immergent</hi> as well as Graces and Vertues. Lyes evil Surmiſes miſconſtructions and the like, will yield Miſapplications of Scriptues and Laws, and theſe then will yield a torrent of <hi>Infamy.</hi> But had he derived only from truth, it had been otherwiſe then now it is, and better for him and us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Page</hi> 9, 10, 11. <hi>He tells us of two ſorts of People among us.</hi> Viz. <hi>The Deceivers and the Deceived, and compares the beſt of theſe to the Rebels on</hi> Abſoloms <hi>ſide, and their caſe and danger like the Regicides, and adviſeth them to take the courſe of</hi> Peter, <hi>who had denied his Lord
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:184806:15"/>and</hi> Maſter, <hi>the other ſort are deſperate &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis to much to Tranſcribe it, but the Reader that hath that <hi>Pamphlet</hi> may examine it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is over what is matter of Fact, as to the main of it; and this, and what follows, for the Subſtance being only his own ſence of the things fore mentioned; we ſhall paſs through them more briefly: And we ſhall once for all, deſire the Candid Reader to take notice; that all his loud Openings and Noiſe, are upon a wrong ſcent; for he purſues us as with-holders of the Kings <hi>Militia,</hi> ſettled by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; when as but newly declared we meddle not with that, but another thing only.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It would and ſhould make any one tremble, to read ſuch things, ſuch Compariſons made on ſuch wrong grounds; but we would know not only the words, but the power of theſe men, thus to Arraign, Condemn, and Execute (as far as <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Imprimatur</hi> Malice can go) Their Majeſties Subjects and the People of God. Surely if the double Fence of Sacred and Civil Laws, had been at all regarded, we had not been thus Broken in upon, and devoured in ſome of our choiſeſt Intereſts: the Holy ninth Command in its ſeveral Branches by the things mentioned, and to be mentioned is by the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> Violated Lyes, Reproaches, evil Surmiſes, Miſconſtructions, Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, and the like, do Violate that Rule. The fifth Command to <hi>Honour Superiours, Equals, Inferiours &amp;c.</hi> Requires the hiding real Blemiſhes, not with <hi>Ham</hi> to ſee and deride, were that the caſe with us, much more it injoyns not to Invade our juſt Repute, with Falſhoods. By the Civil Law we are Their Majeſties Subjects, and as ſuch his Honour is in a degree concerned in ours, and Sugeſtions againſt the Subjects ought to be made to the King, not to the World, to defame the Kings Subjects openly, in the Face of His Enemies, ſorts with no Law or Policy: nothing is to be done in terrour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Kings Peace is to be kept by all, the King hath a Judicature to Iſſue Controverſies, and our cauſe, is at <hi>Caeſars</hi> Judgment Seat where we ought to be judged: who made this man a <hi>Cenſor</hi> over us? But all theſe things notwithſtanding to tear and worry us is what that wretched Tract ſeems deſigned to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What Colour is there that we are with <hi>Abſoloms</hi> Rebels purſuing Their Majeſties, or with the <hi>Regicides</hi> about their work, or have we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with <hi>Peter</hi> our Lord and Maſter.</p>

4. May we not for his thus Comparing us retort his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogations; and ſay, Conſider how he by theſe carriages Elemiſhes Religion and Scandalizes the Goſpel. <hi>Hath he thus Learned Chriſt &amp;c.?</hi> The Tables thus turned would ſtand the righter way.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our Gracious KING and QUEEN, nor any of Their good Subjects, we do believe do like a <hi>Phalaris</hi> with his Brazen <hi>Bull</hi> to Torment men in, to Extremity; which this <hi>Pamphlet</hi> is but too like unto.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Pamphlet</hi> goes on, to tell of the Fountain of good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and what his are, <hi>Page</hi> 12 to <hi>p.</hi> 21. We will give only the heads of them, and his Inferences from them againſt <hi>Connecticut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> 1. <hi>That Allegiance to our Prince is a Morral and neceſſary Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Religion Comprizeth both Tables of the Law.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Morral Law is not aboliſhed by Chriſt.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The manner, and end of Exhibiting theſe <hi>Principles,</hi> is to Sugguſt, that we in <hi>Connecticut</hi> are <hi>Heterodox</hi> in theſe points, and ſo little diſtant from meer <hi>Infidels:</hi> this perverſe Inſinuation we deteſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We own, and deſire to live by theſe Principles, though we are as yet ſo unhappy, as not fully to underſtand our duty in the one point Controverted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore all the pains taken in theſe 11 <hi>Pages,</hi> may juſtly be called, The <hi>New-labour-in-vain;</hi> a waſhing a white man, as if he were a black-more, to make him white, when as he never was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-wiſe.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When or wherein was the Doctrine of Allegiance to our Prince, ſo Oppoſed or Puniſhed among us, as not to be indured? The preſent conteſt turns not on that hinge, whether we ſhall be Subject to Their Majeſties, but what is the true intent of this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? this we may enquire without renouncing our Allegiance.</p>

2. Since the 40 years mentioned, it is well known who Preached an Election Sermon, on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Honour to whom Honour;</hi> and how well he Preſt Obedience to the <hi>Colony</hi> Government thence, and it were well if ſome were ſtill as willing to be minded of their duty to God, and their Brethren, as the body of this People are to be Subject to Their Majeſties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> On the Second Principle, <hi>Page</hi> 17. he ſayes, <hi>But we have ſeen that of late in</hi> Connecticut, <hi>which if</hi> Abraham <hi>himſelf had been here, would have made him ſay as once he did to</hi> Abimelech, <hi>becauſe I thought ſurely the Fear of God is not in this place.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> On the Third, he glances on the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Churches, <hi>and I may add, then, and not before will</hi> Religion <hi>too be ſound and ſafe, when Obedience due to Princes, ſhall be thought to be a part of Piety; and when the</hi> Paſtors <hi>of the Church ſhall Train up the People by the Word of God, to perform Obedience to them.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> On the Fifth, <hi>If our Religion be ſo over grown, to that paſs that it teaches us to deny</hi> Kings <hi>and</hi> Majeſtrates <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Is it not too much that our <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military</hi> benifits, have been ſo ſtruck at by ſome, but muſt our <hi>Profeſſion of Religion</hi> be alſo proſtituted to Contempt in this manner? We profeſs no Religion that teaches to deny <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Majeſtrates:</hi> but of this enough before. Yet we would tell the <hi>Pamphleter,</hi> that he is Suſpected of other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſuch as aforded all the untruths and <hi>Ranchors</hi> of his Book; and that <hi>Leven</hi> hath ſpoyled the uſe of theſe his Principles herein; and however high his Credit hath run abroad, and formerly, we will here tell him: that it is no good Principle for any to hold that a man may Lawfully Marry with his Deceaſed Wives natural Siſter: nor no good Practice to write a Book to juſtify one that hath ſo done; which its ſaid will be Printed; this is contrary not only to the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Proteſtant <hi>Divines,</hi> but even of <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, ſave as he holds that he can diſpence with the Law of God for the good of the Church, and the Manuſcript is now extant to prove this.</p>

               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> In Page</hi> 20 He refumes what he had ſaid of us from Fame, <hi>Viz. That it is our Opinion, that the King hath nothing to do with us; and thereupon proceeds to prove that His Majeſty hath to do with us, as if this laſt were a denyed, or doubted Principle with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is too long to Tranſcribe, for it begins in <hi>Page</hi> 20. and ends in <hi>Page</hi> 25.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But it is <hi>Coincident</hi> with that aleadged opinion as (repreſented by him, by us denyed) and alſo with his fifth Principle but now anſwered; and therefore we need here only ſay what in effect we have ſaid; namely that it is a falſity, and figment of his own, to ſay and inſinuate that we deny Their Majeſties Authority over us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his Interogations, and wretched concluſions on that Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of our denying Their Majeſties we deteſt, and if he will go on with a <hi>Labour in-vain</hi> (unleſs it be to wrong us in the higheſt) he muſt, we can but Vindicate our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We can tell him, that the higheſt word Aſſertors of Soveranty, are not alwayes the trueſt Subjects: <hi>Haman</hi> under pretence of exal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:184806:17"/>Indication of Obedience to Their Majeſties, or Love to Their Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> In Page 22 he ſaith: <hi>It is a manifeſt thing, that this and the other</hi> Homunculus <hi>hath a thouſand times more Authority, Reſpect, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in</hi> Connecticut <hi>than Their Majeſties have. If a man come in Their Majeſties Name, and with Their Commiſſion, he will not be received by us; but if a man come in his own name without Their Majeſties Authority and Commiſſion, him we will receive: This is not the behaviour of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. As to Their Majeſties right in the <hi>Militia,</hi> it hath been owned, and that he may grant Commiſſions accordingly is not to be doubted. But this is not the difficulty, but whether this Commiſſion do reach any other <hi>Militia</hi> than what the Laws of the Realm do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, and this the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> in words at leaſt yields in our ſence, for in <hi>Page</hi> 29. thus he ſaith, <hi>This Commiſſion is therefore a Lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion being founded upon the Antient and ſtanding Laws of the Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then there be an Inſeperable Connection between this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and the ſtanding Laws of the Realm, and it be founded on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:184806:17"/>them, and that Act of 13 <hi>&amp;</hi> 14 <hi>of Charles II.</hi> be ſuch a ſtanding Law? then this Commiſſion is meaſured and limited by that Law, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, was never denyed that we know of. But (2.) If they will extend it to a <hi>Militia</hi> of another Conſtitution, <hi>Viz.</hi> The <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration Conſtitution;</hi> then there is matter of Law in it, not only to be diſputed, but to be tryed, or at leaſt to be inquired of Their Majeſties, whether it be Lawful or no in that Extent. (3.) Their Majeſties pleaſure may be ſought, even as to that which the ſaid Act (if applyed) would take out of our Conſtitution of the <hi>Militia;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many things may be, and we hope are ſaid before them. (4.) If men that have neither 50 <hi>Pound Starling Per. Annum,</hi> nor 600 <hi>Starl.</hi> in Money or Goods (as moſt with us are ſuch) ſhall refuſe the duty of a Souldier in the ſtanding <hi>Militia,</hi> what Law that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is dependant on, will condemn them for ſo doing? and this as has been hinted will be our caſe; if the <hi>Colony Militia</hi> (ſo to call it which is the Kings too in a ſence) be diſolved; but of this we gave an account before; yet could not well omit this further notice of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> In Page 31. he reflects on the Government as Severe and Sharp, <hi>Upon any diſacknowledgment of our diſputable Authority.

But whether he be within bounds of truth, Sobriety, or Charity, let any one Judge; when he ſaith, <hi>Shall we requite Love with Hatred, Tender Bowels with Malignanty? for what elſe can our behaviour ſignify, but a Malignant Spirit and Inveterat Hatred, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King as King, and who ever comes from him as ſuch?

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:184806:19"/>Rebellion or Inſurrection is a levying War againſt the King. That a gathering Forces for the Removal of Councellors Altering of Laws &amp;c. is levying of War againſt the King. That the holding a Fort or Caſtle by force of Arms againſt the King and His Power is a levying War againſt the King &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We muſt refer to what hath be ſaid chiefly for anſwer to theſe things; to avoid vain and tedious Repetitions; but as theſe things are applyed unto us, we may ſay as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to <hi>Sanbalat</hi> Chap. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>There are no ſuch things as though ſayeſt, but thou feigneſt them out of thine own heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Hath not <hi>Connecticut</hi> an uncondemned right to ſomewhat of a <hi>Militia?</hi> Why may we not in the reverſs, charge as hard thoſe that interupt us; eſpecially conſidering that the General Government is (under Their Majeſties) yet in the Corporations hand, to which particular Officers (though by Patent) one would think ſhould ſtand in ſome Subordination.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, that we miſtake him; he doth not charge us with Treaſon, levying War againſt the King; he layes it only as a ground to argue from, as he doth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> What Conſtruction then do we think it will have, If we ſhall be found to Riſe in Arms againſt the Kings Lieutenant Publiſhing His Commiſſion, and Commanding Obedience unto it; and by Force and Arms, to with-hold the</hi> Militia, <hi>and all Forces by Sea and Land, and all Forts and places of ſtrength, in a whole</hi> Colony, <hi>or</hi> Province, <hi>from the King againſt His plain Commiſſion Publiſhed under the great Seal?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The <hi>[if]</hi> that all this is propounded with, makes it like a wet <hi>Eale,</hi> hard to take any hold on, or how to uſe it; but he intends not to beat Air, but to ſtrike us in theſe things; and becauſe here he ſeems to clench moſt of his Coblery we ſay.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he argue from the former of Treaſon <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to this of our holding (which he will call with-holding) the <hi>Militia,</hi> that the latter is as great, as bad, as the former or worſe; then we did not miſtake him; and indeed his ſence Suites beſt his Scope in the whole Book.

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:184806:20"/>
3. If he argue from the greater to the leſſer, there is no great force in it: for though it be Fellony to kill a Man, yet it is not ſo to kill a Fly; though a man may not Rob, yet he may ſtand a Tryal in Law, for what he hath held quietly a long time (on a good tenure) ere he Surrender; and if finally he ſhould be Ejected, yet a Tryal is due to him, ere a delivery is due from him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All a long the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> beggs, and not proves the main queſtion; for he ſtill runs away with this, that our Charter now gives us no uſe of any <hi>Militia</hi> at all; and on that Suppoſition he builds in a manner all his diſcourſe: but this we differ from him in, and take it our right to have Their Majeſties, and the Laws deſciſſion in.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What if after all this his Scuffle to bring our heads with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his halter; the Charter and his Excellencies Commiſſion, ſhould be found to refer to divers <hi>Militia's,</hi> the one to a Corporation <hi>Militia,</hi> as formed by the General Court to our neceſſity, and without which we are undone; and the other to the Kings <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> according to the 13 and 14 of <hi>Charles II.</hi> Or, which is almoſt the ſame, that they ſhould refer to the ſame <hi>Militia,</hi> in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: Namely, the one to what of our <hi>Militia</hi> falls not within the verges of that Act forementioned, and the other to what of it that Act will on tryal be found to Comprehend; will not this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Charter and Commiſſion? Or what if the Law, or Their Majeſties Grace, will firm our former and preſent Station in theſe things? theſe things are not only poſſible, but hopeful, and he might have ſtaid his hand, and not have run out upon us as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as worſe than <hi>Turks</hi> as diſpiſers of the King, as he doth, <hi>Page</hi> 40.41.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A Conteſt with His Excellency, is not a Conteſt with the King; if <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Uliſſes</hi> ſtrive for <hi>Achiles</hi> Armour, this makes neither an Enemy to <hi>Achiles</hi> nor the <hi>Greeks:</hi> if <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but Juriſdiction, neither is hereby a Rebel againſt <hi>Ceſar:</hi> Are not Conteſts about Rights to particular Commands frequent in the Courts of Princes? And though but one can prevail, yet is not the other made a Traitor for holding what he had till a deciſſion be. The <hi>Pamphlet</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:184806:20"/>over charges, in ſaying (in a caſe thus Circumſtanced) <hi>That diſobedience and Contempt offered to the Kings Miniſters, redounds and is done to the King Himſelf</hi> (for <hi>Connecticut</hi> is the Kings Miniſter alſo)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> But he is bold at all adventures, to affirm that beſides, <hi>other vile Indignities (not fit to be named) His Excellency is in danger of his very Life, ſuch as aſſert their Allegiance and declare their Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, run the ſame Hazard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is not the firſt nor ſecond time we have found him at the trade of Impudent Falfifying, as is before noted; there was no appearance to give ground of ſuch ſayings; His Excellency was with all freedom and ſafty among us, nor were his Servants or any hurt or aſſautled in the leaſt degree, that ever we heard of: true it is he lodging at a Publick houſe and Inn, there was a concourſe of People of different perſwaſions, and that diſcourſes, and diſputes were many is without queſtion, as there are on many Occaſions: yet to raiſe ſuch things to an hazard of His Excellencies Life, or others; is a falſe Inference; Can he ſay that any man ſhouldered a Gun, girt on a Sword, lift up ſo much as a Staff, or hand in ſuch a way? we have a full account of the contrary, we are deeply injured therefore, thus to be repreſented to the World, as a Company of <hi>Aſſaſmates;</hi> and he that gave his <hi>Imprimatur</hi> to this, had reaſon enough to know the Contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> In <hi>Page</hi> 42, thus he ſayes, <hi>Some may Imagine they have found a Neat way to defeat the Kings Commiſſion, they will not take Commiſſions from His Lieutenant themſelves, but will alſo deter others &amp;c. — What! do we think he is to be put off with our Scurvy little tricks &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here he finds he touches ground, for all this while he hath been but floating, and hath contended only with words of the Courts <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when as not withſtanding that Indeavours were uſed, to find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to take Commiſſions, and ſuch an univerſal adherence to what was ſettled by the Charter was found in the People, as that thoſe propoſals would not take, and that this gave a <hi>Remora</hi> to all preſent further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: the Obſervation of this puts the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> into this Rage, and paſſionate Exclamation againſt (whom he knows beſt) perhaps he meanes the Governour firſt, and then the Court, as thus perſwaded. But
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:184806:21"/>this is a groundleſs Surmiſe; it was the ſet and Spirit of thoſe to whom ſuch Commiſſions were offered, and of the whole Country in a manner, which they were ſenſible of that ſtood in the way; and needed not the adjuvancy of any of the Court to perſwade to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since the proceedings ſtoped here, he might have ſpared moſt of his Labour in taxing the Court with oppoſing (as he will call it) that Commiſſion, and laying its preſent Ineffectiveneſs there where it centred not. Let this be well noted, and it will eaſe moſt of the other difficukies that are urged againſt us: Since it is run a ground here in our <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleters</hi> own account, though it rubbed elſe where.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet is there reaſon enough to believe, that thoſe few that were asked to take Commiſſion (and they were very few indeed by all we can learn) and that at a ſecond third or forth hand way (which may clear the moſt, and thoſe few too, of refuſing) none did it, nor any others would do it, in the leaſt unwillingneſs to Serve Their Majeſties, (for Them they Serve with their preſent Commiſſions) but as well underſtanding their previledg and Intereſt, from which a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> has not moved them; and the general ſence and ſet of the People, is an argument of more weight in this affair, then we ſhall now inſiſt on.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet the this uſing their Liberty, doth not render their Obedience to Their Majeſties Arbitrary neither; nor is it a putting Them off with Scurvy little tricks; it is but a waiting to have that made clear in their Alteration (if it muſt be ſo) which yet is doubtful it ſeems to ſome.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Nor will this not taking Commiſſions merrit Their Majeſties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as he ſuggeſts, <hi>Page</hi> 43.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nor is it a neceſſary Conſequence from not taking the Commiſſions ſo offered (if any were) that ſuch are like, <hi>the Citizens in the Parable that hated their Lord and that would not have Him Reign over them</hi> (Nor that therefore His Majeſty ſhould or will ſay) <hi>Thoſe mine Enemies that would not that I ſhould Reign over them bring hither and Slay them before me,</hi> as <hi>p.</hi> 43.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Nor yet that we and our poſterity ſhall be ruined, be declared Rebels, put out of Protection, be ſhut out of Commerce, be reduced by

            <p>We muſt confeſs theſe things though hard, are a great abatement of what went before, of being Slain: But they only ſignify and are Effects of an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> and Horrible prejudication, on weak grounds, without any Authority; and for a cloſe he ſhews how loath he is, that theſe things (or ſome of them) ſhould not befall us; in theſe words, <hi>and it is a new ſort of Grace if They (Their Majeſties) do nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be thought this man hath forgot that he writes in the Reign, and within the dominions of Juſt and Gracious KING WILLIAM and QUEEN MARY.</p>
            <p>Now at laſt, we have the Fiſh that has all this while, and with all this Baiting and Angling for been ſought, as the prey, brought out; and the white all theſe Arrows Aimed at; ſet open in <hi>Page</hi> 44, 45.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Pam.</hi> Let all good Subjects then Conſider, and as they would deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Common Guilt, ſo let them diſtinguiſh themſelves, and make haſt to yield their due Obedience. And as for the Reſt, we may ſay, Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We believe it will not be found in any Inſtructions from Their Majeſties, that Their Commiſſion to His Excellency ſhould be forwarded in theſe turbulent wayes, moving for Commotions among Their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who are in Peace among themſelves; Save this and a few more Male contents (and ſo on other grounds than this buſineſs) and we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves, that it will diſpleaſe them and all good men that ſhall Conſider it, that private Perſons ſhould over the heads of thoſe that here Serve Their Majeſties in the Government.; thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak the People of this Their <hi>Colony:</hi> make ſuch diſtinctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and eſpecially that the Holy Scriptures, the Laws and Their Majeſties name, have been put to ſuch ill uſes, as are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where obvious, and that the ſame ſhould have an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What he means by due Obedience, is evident from his Scope; but if any ſhould ask how, or in what way ſhall we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:184806:22"/>yield it, as the caſe now ſtands? he ſayes nothing by way of direction, for if he had its moſt probable that the executing it, would openly have Violated Peace, and Order, to beget an ill affection therefore againſt the preſent diſpenſations in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo to make way for ſome other, ſeems to be the drift of all this ill taken pains with the People. But ſurely our Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, or changes, muſt or ſhould come from Their Majeſties; and not by theſe meanes.</p>
            <p>What follows is only ſeveral <hi>Objections</hi> (moſt of which are his own, not ours) and his Anſwer to them, to which we will briefly <hi>Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I. Objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Militia is very well diſpoſed of all ready; King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second of happy Memory, did by His</hi> Charter <hi>for Himſelf and His Succeſſors, Grant it to us and our Succeſſors, in the Year</hi> 1662.</p>
            <p>It is too much to Tranſcribe his whole anſwer, the Sum of it is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we overween our Charter. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the King knows our Charter, and how the <hi>Militia</hi> was diſpoſed thereby. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Charter never granted us a ſtanding <hi>Militia. Fourthly,</hi> Nor to ſend men abroad. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That what was granted was not to the General Court. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Nor no places of Strength, Forts <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To all theſe things we need ſay no more, but that the clauſes in our Charter, and thoſe Equivalent, in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> former Charter, and <hi>Rhoad-Iſland</hi> Charter, were alwayes underſtood and practized upon, as Commiſſionating a ſtanding <hi>Militia,</hi> and the Rule of it to be next the King, firſt in the General Court, and that we could aid our Neighbours, hold Forts <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without which we had been undone in the <hi>Indian</hi> War, and in no ſafty at any time.</p>
            <p>But the diſcuſſion of theſe points is large, and of little uſe here: where the diſpute is confined to the Suppoſed Competition of our Charter, and His Excellencies Commiſſion, for the <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He reaſons all the Charter granted is void, becauſe <hi>the</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia <hi>is a Jewel of the Crown not to be granted by the King from His Succeſſors, it is like</hi> Abiſhag <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. We need not it is in vain, and therefore we will not here medle with that Queſtion, how far in a Charter to a foreign Plantation a King may make a grant of the <hi>Militia,</hi> for and from His Succeſſors: it is plain that ſuch a grant there is; but we wave that here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet we have before ſhewn, that the Kings <hi>Militia</hi> as ſettled by 13 and 13 and 14. of <hi>Charles II.</hi> is a diſtinct thing from the <hi>Militia</hi> as ſettled here; ſo that though the grant may not hold as to the former, againſt His Succeſſors, yet it may as to the latter, as being no part of that undemiſſible Jewel of the Crown, as we ſuppoſe, and withal, that as yet that is undiſtinguiſhed in this <hi>Colony,</hi> from the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> It is Anſwered by him in <hi>Page</hi> 47, <hi>That our Succeſſion was determined in</hi> 1688. <hi>So that we cannot talk of Succeſſion or Succeſſors, without ſome new grant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This indeed if it would hold does all the buſineſs at once, for our Charter is gone then, and we know who hath played on this String all along ſince that Year. Tis a large field, we will enter it no further now, than to ſay that as Good Judgments as we could get in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>New-England</hi> are otherwiſe. Nor have Their Majeſties ſo declared yet of it, but rather otherwiſe: but this is in <hi>England</hi> where we leave it.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is to put a Cheat upon the World, and an abuſe upon us, to render us as thus Objecting, like much of what is already detected, begetting Brats and Fathering them on the body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on whom he does reflect in his Promiſcuous Charge; to Render us Odious and Rediculous; he claps a fools Coat on us, and then derides us in his Anſwers; but this is no diſappointment to us what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wrong it be, we could look for no better from a Perſon ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:184806:23"/>as he in this <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> He and his <hi>Imprimatur</hi> may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of ſuch things. What if ſome few ſhould quere at the rate of this Objection? Is it thereby a General Court or Colony Objection? the Court never in their anſwers, took it for other then a reality: as is plain by the Printed account of thoſe Tranſactions.</p>
            <p>His <hi>III. Objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King hath given us no command to Surrender the</hi> Militia <hi>to His Excellency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he ſlights as a poor Shift, <hi>as if Their Majeſties Commiſſion to His Excellency to Command were not Command for us to Obey &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> It is one thing for a Command to come to the Objects of it immediately, and another for it to come to them by a <hi>Medium</hi> (as the Government is where under they are) Again, tis one thing for a Command to come without a Competiting Command, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when tis otherwiſe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Its one thing for a Command to be clear and indiſputable in its intent, and another thing where tis not ſo.</p>
            <p>If this Command muſt influence. (1.) The General Court and by them the People: if withal the General Court have a power to the ſame Command, and theſe powers are not cleared from interfering, in ſuch a caſe, and when theſe alſo are depending for Iſſue, we ſay a Commiſſion to Command is not imediately a Command to Obey, till thoſe incumbrances are removed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have cauſe to believe, that the not nuling our right in the <hi>Militia,</hi> nor giving Orders for Surrendering: was done by Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, to give us the opportunity of applying to Them, in reference to it, in both the Commiſſions, or elſe as well our power as <hi>
                  <hi>Sir.</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Phipps,</hi> we think had been determined expreſly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Common reaſon ſuggeſts, that every one in truſt, is to mind his own Orders, and Inſtances of this are plentifully diſcourſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Charter Grant is of that nature, that (ſo far as it is good) we think a particular Order does not null it, wherefore we lay not the ſtreſs of this matter chiefly there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> He ſayes, <hi>His Excellency Demands no Surrender of the</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia: <hi>But Obedience to His Commiſſion, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:184806:23"/>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> We ask, what was that Obedience he demanded of our General Court? or what Obedience were they Capable of herein as a General Court but a Surrender? Or why is our Court ſo faulted with oppoſition and diſobedience all a long; if they were capable of no Surrender? or had no demand thereof as here he ſaith? by this account their Audience, of the Commiſſion, and not actually reſiſting his Executing it; was our Complyance, and diſcharge, and this he had to the full; and yet complanes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> The laſt part of his anſwer to this Objection, ſtands thus, <hi>Did Their Majeſties ever give Their Subjects any Command to yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our reſumed power? We lately received a Letter from Their Majeſties; did Their Majeſties therein or any otherwiſe give the People any imediate and expreſs Command to obey us, in what we were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon about to do? Yet we expect Obedience from them, without any ſuch Command, and are not we Their Majeſties Subjects as well as the reſt of the People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This is a poor ſhift indeed: Is it reaſonable or poſſible, that every Individual Subject, in his private capacity, ſhould have His Majeſties particular command; as it is reaſonable and poſſible, that a Body Politick or Publick Perſon ſhould? Every Inferiour is to attend the Orders of his Superiour, but Their Majeſties are our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, we may expect Their Orders therefore, though our Inferiours muſt take up with ours.</p>
            <p>His <hi>IV. Objection. But we cannot manage our Government without the</hi> Militia.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection is of great weight, and requires a large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to handle it, but its to no purpoſe here to inſiſt on it; only this is the general ſence, that if all <hi>Militia</hi> be taken from us, the Civil part of the Government will be extreamly weakened, if not deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby; things in this reſpect are not here as in <hi>England,</hi> as might be demoſtrated if that were here to be done. The hitherto conſtant Conjoying of the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military</hi> power in the foreign Plantations, is evidence enough of the neceſſity of the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What is a Body without ſome what defenſive and offenſive, but a prey, or at anothers Arbitriment?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:184806:24"/>
His <hi>V. Objection.</hi> Is <hi>Coincident</hi> with the former, only he adds ſome-what about our annexing to <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> We ſhall wave this for the moſt of it, as being no preſent inquiry whether it be good for us to be annexed to <hi>York?</hi> that is not our bufineſs; and though he ſpeak of it as indifferent, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable, yet our People tis well known deſire their old Station.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas ſome mention is made there, of our Aiding <hi>Leiſler,</hi> which ſome may take in a wrong ſence; we ſay that what we did therein, was only out of a ſincere reſpect to Their Majeſties, at the Solicitation of <hi>Albany,</hi> and of <hi>Maſſachuſetts;</hi> and it is known that Perſons of Honour came from <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> and one from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and joyned with our Agents there, in that matter; and the State of that Province, and of affairs in general needed it, and it was not out of any ſiniſter or perſonal reſpect to Mr. <hi>Leiſler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. His Suppoſitions of our Shouldering out the Kings Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he inſiſts on, are meer Imaginations of his own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground given, to it by us.</p>
            <p>His <hi>VI. Objection</hi> about <hi>Rates</hi> are impertinent; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the <hi>Long-Iſlanders,</hi> though loud, is not our buſineſs; unleſs it be to wiſh that others eſpouſed no more the complaints of Male contents here, than we do theirs, who they give that name to there.</p>
            <p>His <hi>VII. Objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Governour of</hi> York <hi>is a Proud Moroſs Stearn and Auſteer Man &amp;c.</hi> And His <hi>VIII. Objection, That he is a</hi> Papiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> We ſay to theſe in Sum, what we ſaid to his ſecond <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;</hi> Let the Reader turn to it, and when theſe are not our <hi>Objections,</hi> 'tis hard to be falſly taxed and thereupon to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reproached as there; <hi>Viz. Who knows when the</hi> Devil <hi>and his Children, will have done Lying and Slandering</hi>—(and calls us) <hi>a Rude, Proud, Ungoverned, Diſorderly People, as we have declared our ſelves to be:</hi> And more to that effect as there it follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If theſe his dealings with our <hi>Colony</hi> be not Rude, Proud,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:184806:24"/>Ungoverned and Diſorderly, we think never any ſuch will be found in <hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>Ink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what <hi>Encomiums</hi> he is pleaſed to give His Excellency, we need to ſay nothing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam:</hi> For a farewell, and as the Sum of all, to give our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as we ſtand in his account, he cites at large 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.26, 27. <hi>There went with</hi> Saul <hi>a Band of men whoſe hearts God had touched, but the Children of</hi> Belial <hi>ſaid, How ſhall this man ſave us? and they diſpiſed him &amp;c. But he held his Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Who theſe Compariſons intend is notorious; we have only this kindneſs from him therein; that he tells not the World how ſmall a number that Band he aludes to, was; for then in all probability, it would have been known, that he had called almoſt all the men in <hi>Connecticut Colony,</hi> Children of <hi>Belial:</hi> And there is one thing in it, that is Extreamly and to Admiration ſtrange, and that is; that ſince his <hi>Saul</hi> was ſo wiſe as to hold his Peace, that he (one of his followers) ſhould be ſo very fooliſh, as to write ſo much (and in the manner as he hath) about it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pam.</hi> Laſtly, he cites, <hi>John</hi> 1.46. Nathaniel <hi>ſaid can any good come out of</hi> Nazareth? Philip <hi>ſayes to him, come and ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> We leave it to the Sober and Pious, whether he did not begin, go on, and hath not ended in a dreadful prophanneſs; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Third</hi> Commandment, which enjoyns the true and Reverend uſe of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
